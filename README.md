# ReactJS Day 21 ðŸš€  

In this project, I practiced three very important concepts in React: *Derived State, **Lifting State Up, and **Updating Objects in State*.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Concepts Covered  

### 1. Derived State in React  
- Instead of storing redundant values, I derived values such as:  
  - *Total users*  
  - *Last user added*  
  - *Unique users* (using Set)  

This helps avoid duplication and makes the state more predictable.  

---

### 2. Lifting State Up  
- When multiple child components need to share and update data, I *lifted the state* to their parent component.  
- This ensures *data consistency* and avoids prop-drilling issues.  

---

### 3. Updating Objects in State  
- I updated nested object properties like address.city without mutating the state.  
- Used the spread operator (...) to keep immutability intact while updating values.

## âš› Example Features  
- Add new users  
- Display total, last, and unique users  
- Update object properties inside state (like changing user city dynamically)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

src
â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx          # Main component (handles state, derived data, lifting state)
â”œâ”€â”€ AddUser.jsx      # Component to add new user
â”œâ”€â”€ DisplayUser.jsx  # Component to display user details
â”œâ”€â”€ App.css          # Styling
â””â”€â”€ main.jsx         # Entry point

## ðŸš€ How to Run  

1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd project-folder

2. Install dependencies

npm install


3. Run the development server

npm run dev

ðŸŒŸ Learnings

âœ” Derived state makes code cleaner and avoids unnecessary state updates.
âœ” Lifting state up ensures smooth data flow across components.
âœ” Correctly updating objects in state helps maintain immutability.
